## For Developers

Built with **React + TypeScript**, featuring:
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive UI
- **Voice synthesis (SSML)** for guided brewing instructions
- **Cloudflare Pages** for fast and reliable hosting

### Voice Guidance
The app uses **SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)** to create natural-sounding countdown voice cues before each step:

```xml
<speak>
  <par>
    <media xml:id="three" begin="0s">
      <speak><prosody rate="x-fast">3</prosody></speak>
    </media>

    <media xml:id="two" begin="three.begin+1.0s">
      <speak><prosody rate="x-fast">2</prosody></speak>
    </media>

    <media xml:id="one" begin="two.begin+1.0s">
      <speak><prosody rate="x-fast">1</prosody></speak>
    </media>

    <media begin="one.begin+1.0s">
      <speak><prosody rate="medium">Next Step!</prosody></speak>
    </media>
  </par>
</speak>
```
